Amortization is the process of paying the debt in regular installments over a period of time in one of the following ways:

1. **Loan Repayment:**  
   Paying off a debt with a fixed repayment schedule in regular installments over a period of time.  
   *Example:* Mortgage, Car Loan.

2. **Expense Recognition:**  
   Spreading out capital expenses for intangible assets over a specific period — typically over the asset’s useful life for accounting and tax purposes.

### Depreciation
Used for **tangible** assets (e.g., machinery, equipment).  
Represents an **annual reduction** in the asset's value due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or usage.

Represents the percentage of company earnings paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends.

**Formulas:**  
DPR = Total Dividends / Net Income

## 📈 Forecast & Growth Calculations

### Growth Rate (Year-on-Year)
Growth Rate = (Present Revenue / Past Revenue) - 1

### Future Value

Each following year:  
**Growth Rate should reduce by 1%** compared to previous year.

## 📊 Financial Forecasting Formulas

### Gross Profit Margin
Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue

### EBITDA Margin
EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Total Revenue

### EBIT Margin
EBIT Margin = EBIT / EBITDA

## 📉 Tax and Dividends

### NPAT (Net Profit After Tax)
NPAT = PBT - Annual Tax
Margin = NPAT / Total Revenue

### Gross Dividends
Gross Dividends = DPR × NPAT

## 🧮 Cash Flow Forecasting

### Net Interest
Net Interest = (Opening Cash × Debt Interest Rate) - (Debt Interest Rate × Opening Debt)
### Net CapEx
Net CapEx = (Net Capital Expenditure / Total Revenue)

### Conditional Formula for Debt Repayment
= IF(Opening Debt > Net Cash Flow, -Net Cash Flow, -Opening Debt)

**Note:**  
Cash to Balance Sheet = **Net Cash Flow**
